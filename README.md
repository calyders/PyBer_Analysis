# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
#### The goal for this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame by city type for the ride-sharing data. We then used Matplotlib to create different line graphs, showcasing the total weekly fares for each city. 
#### The reasoning behind this was to find how the data differs from city to city and use that to help better inform the decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results
#### The data shows that Urban areas provide the highest number of fares, with a small spike in Febuary and March. Suburban areas are the next highest producing and Rural is last. Both of these locations also have small spike in Feburary. Each city type is consistant in their placement on the chart with Urban always producing the most and Rural always producing the least. The assumed reasoning for this is the population size and density for each of these city types, Urban cities obviously having the higher number of occupants.

## Summary
### Recommendations
#### Firstly, while the data for each city type looks to be consistant in their numbers, it would still be more beneficial to use data spanning a longer period of time. Using data that encompasses all twelve months for an entire year would provide much more insight, even if the data per city type still seems consistant in its numbers as it does now.
#### Secondly, while having the numbers for total rides, drivers and fares is helpful, it would be interesting to have the population number for each city type to compare these numbers to. With the population size of each city type (or even an estimate based off other cities) the percentage of riders and drivers could be seen for each of these types and better inform the decision-makers on who is really using these rides.
#### Thirdly, with the data provided by the previous suggestion, it would be worthwile to use those percentages to decide what the demand in each area looks like and use that to inform decision-makers on where to focus their efforts and drivers.
